### **About Me**
*Data professional* & *Lifelong learner* with interests in databases, data infrastructure, data streaming, analytics, data apps and open-source software.

I currently work at [Nasdaq](https://www.nasdaq.com/) as an [Analytics Engineer](https://www.getdbt.com/what-is-analytics-engineering/) focusing on our ETF listings business.

My ambition is to help build systems, infrastructure and technology that empowers others.

I'm driven by gratitude.

### **Background**
Before pursing a career in data, I wanted to work in investment management. I graduated Dec 2019 with a B.S. in Finance.

My first job out of college was in the investment management department of a fortune 650 insurance company. It wasn't till after I passed the [CFA](https://www.cfainstitute.org/en/programs/cfa/charter) level 1 exam that I knew this wasn't the career for me. What I did discover was my interest in computer science, data and technology. 

I started working on my technical skills through various resources (MOOCs, Books, YouTube, Side Projects). I went from Data Analyst ‚û°Ô∏è BI Developer ‚û°Ô∏è Analytics Engineer all within one year.

I spend most of free time filling in my knowledge gaps about core computer science topics. I am really interested in system internals and have been taking a bottom up approach to learning about computer science. 

My current career goal is to work as a software engineer focused in one of the following areas:

- Data Platform
- Data Infrastructure
- Data Streaming 
- Data Applications
- Database Development

Outside of data and technology: 

- I have a beautiful wife who has a passion for bodybuilding
- I have a twin brother 
- Recently moved to Scottsdale, Arizona üåµ
- Big fan of the Milwaukee Bucks #BucksIn6 ü¶å
- I co-authored a paper [Inside the hiring process: how managers assess employability based on grit, the big five, and other factors ](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/335182644_Inside_the_hiring_process_how_managers_assess_employability_based_on_grit_the_big_five_and_other_factors)
