### **About Me**
I pride myself as a *Lifelong Learner*.

I currently work at [supabase](https://supabase.com/) as a Data Engineer. Try us out at [database.new](https://database.new/)

My ambition is to help build systems, infrastructure and technology that empowers others.

I'm driven by gratitude.

### **Background**
Before pursing a career in tech, I wanted to work in investment management. I graduated Dec 2019 with a B.S. in Finance.

My first job out of college was in the investment management department of a fortune 650 insurance company working in investment operations and helping manage our money market portfolio. It wasn't till after I passed the [CFA](https://www.cfainstitute.org/en/programs/cfa/charter) level 1 exam that I knew this career wasn't for me. What I did discover was my interests in computer science, data and technology. 

I am a generalist. While most of my background has been in various data roles I don't let that define who I am. I am continuously learning about different domains from web development, database internals, devops, networking etc. 

It bothers me when people don't believe someone can be "Full Stack" or they consider themselves a "Insert X framework dev". Don't be a frameworker be a developer. At the end of the day I am a problem solver and I am willing to learn or do whatever it takes to solve the task at hand.

This philosophy closely aligns with one of my favorite books "The Pragmatic Programmer":

  > You shouldn't be wedded to any particular technology, but have a broad background and experience based to allow you to choose good solutions in particular situations... Your current role may require you to be a specialist but you'll always be able to move on to new areas and new challenges

If you want to be a "X dev" choose to be a pragmatic one. 

Outside of tech: 

- I have a beautiful wife who has a passion for bodybuilding
- I have a twin brother 
- Recently moved to Scottsdale, Arizona ðŸŒµ
- Big fan of the Milwaukee Bucks #BucksIn6 ðŸ¦Œ
- I co-authored a paper [Inside the hiring process: how managers assess employability based on grit, the big five, and other factors ](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/335182644_Inside_the_hiring_process_how_managers_assess_employability_based_on_grit_the_big_five_and_other_factors)
