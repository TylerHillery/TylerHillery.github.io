### **About Me**

I pride myself as a *Lifelong Learner*.

I currently work at [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) as a Data Engineer. Try us out at [database.new](https://database.new/)

My ambition is to help build systems, infrastructure and technology that empowers others.

I'm driven by gratitude.

### **Background**

Before pursing a career in tech, I wanted to work in investment management. I graduated Dec 2019 with a B.S. in Finance.

My first job out of college was in the investment management department of a fortune 650 insurance company working in investment operations and helping manage our money market portfolio. It wasn't till after I passed the [CFA](https://www.cfainstitute.org/en/programs/cfa/charter) level 1 exam that I knew this career wasn't for me. What I did discover was my interests in computer science, data and technology.

In Summer 2021, I started to working on my technical skills outside of work through various resources (Books, YouTube etc.). My favorite way to learn is by first getting a general high level understanding of a topic and then dive into building [projects](https://www.tylerhillery.com/projects.html).

In today's world of software development there are so many layers of abstractions we build upon. I try my best to peel back each layer to understand the core fundamentals, principals and patterns that stay true across technologies.

While most of my background has been in various data roles I donâ€™t let that define who I am. I am continuously learning about different domains from web development, software internals, devops, networking etc.

With that being said these are some of my favorite topics to learn about:

-   Customer-Facing Analytics
-   Data Streaming
-   Event Driven Architecture
-   Ruthless Automation
-   Database Internals

Outside of tech:

-   I have a beautiful wife who has a passion for bodybuilding
-   I have a twin brother
-   Recently moved to Scottsdale, Arizona ðŸŒµ
-   Big fan of the Milwaukee Bucks #BucksIn6 ðŸ¦Œ
-   I co-authored a paper [Inside the hiring process: how managers assess employability based on grit, the big five, and other factors](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/335182644_Inside_the_hiring_process_how_managers_assess_employability_based_on_grit_the_big_five_and_other_factors)
