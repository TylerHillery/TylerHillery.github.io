I'm a self proclaimed *Data practitioner* & *Lifelong learner* with interests in data infrastructure, engineering, distributed systems, programming, analytics, OSS, data processing & storage. 

I currently work at [Nasdaq](https://www.nasdaq.com/) as an [Analytics Engineering](https://www.getdbt.com/what-is-analytics-engineering/) focusing on customer facing analytics. 

My ambition is to help build systems, infrastructure and technology that makes data more accessible.

Before pursing a career in data, I wanted to work in investment management. I graduated Dec 2019 with a B.S. in Finance.

My first job out of college was in the investment management department of a fortune 650 insurance company. It wasn't till after I passed the [CFA](https://www.cfainstitute.org/en/programs/cfa/charter) level 1 exam that I knew this wasn't the career for me. What I did discover was my interest in data and technology. 

I started working on my technical skills through various resources (MOOCs, Books, YouTube, Side Projects). I went from Data Analyst --> BI Developer --> Analytics Engineer all within one year. I have found the Analytics Engineer role really fits me as a [purple person](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/we-the-purple-people/) and [generalist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wB0ulHmvU7E). 

I spend most of free time filling in my knowledge gaps about core Computer Science topics. As a finance major I have a lot of catching up to do ðŸ™‚

Outside of data and technology: 

- I have a beautiful fiance who has a passion for bodybuilding
- I have a twin brother 
- Currently live in Wisconsin 
- Big fan of the Milwaukee Bucks #BucksIn6
- Occasional CrossFitter
- I co-authored a paper [Inside the hiring process: how managers assess employability based on grit, the big five, and other factors ](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/335182644_Inside_the_hiring_process_how_managers_assess_employability_based_on_grit_the_big_five_and_other_factors)
