## Summary

**Rating**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Throughout this book I found myself saying "*Wow, so that's how that works!*". For those who looking to gain a deeper understanding about computer internals this book is for you. The author does a great job slowly introducing these computer science topics in gentle ways gradually leading up to how a computer is built.
