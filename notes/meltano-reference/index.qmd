# Notes 
 
- Plugin Types
  - extractors (Singer Taps)
  - loaders (Singer Targets)
  - utilities (dbt, airflow, dagster etc.)

- When you install plugins with `meltano add` they get installed into the project's `.meltano` directory. This directory is in the `.gitignore` so you'll need to explicitly run `meltano install` 

- Just learning now that `~=` in pip means to install anything in the specified minor version e.g. `requests~=2.31.0` will install anything in the 31 minor version

- Data Replication Methods
  - Log-based Incremental Replication: Uses the database's binary log files to identify what records were inserted, updated, and deleted from the table since the last run (if any), and extracts only these records
  - Key-based Incremental Replication: The extractor uses the value of a specific column on the table (e.g. `updated_at` or incrementing `id` integer) to identify what records were inserted or updated since the last run (if any)
  - Full Table Replication: Extracts all available records in the table on every run

- You can use the `--environment=dev` to specify environments you want to run meltano in
