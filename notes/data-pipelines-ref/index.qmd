This book does a great job of providing real world examples of data pipeline work. I can already see myself referring back to it in the future when I am looking for examples of how certain things are done. The author does a great job outlining reusable patterns that can be applied broadly. Very quick read and a book I would definitely recommend to other data professionals or those that want a better idea of day to day data engineering work.
