# Notes
> This is where pragmatism comes in. You shouldn't be wedded to any particular technology, but have a broad enough background and experience based to all you to choose good solutions in particular situations

- This preface was so good. I could tell right off the bat that this book was going 
to be one of my favorites

- I really identify with some of the traits of a Pragmatic Programmer:
    - Early adopter / Fast adopter
        - Instinct for new tech
        - Love to try things out
        - Grasp new things quickly and can integrate it with the rest of your knowledge
        - Confidence is born from experience
    - Inquisitive
        - Tends to ask questions
        - Pack rat for little facts, each of which may affect some decisions years from now
    - Critical Thinker
        - Rarely take things as given without first getting the facts
        - When people say "because that's the way things are done" you smell a challenge 
    - Realistic
        - Try to understand the underlying nature of each problem you face
        - The realism gives you a good feel for how difficult things ares, and how long things with take
        - Deeply understanding that a process should be difficult or will take a while to complete gives you the stamina to keep at it.
    - Jack of all Trades
        - Be familiar with a broad range of tech
        - Your current role may require you to be a specialist but you'll always be able to move on to new areas and new challenges

::: {.callout-tip icon="false" title="💡Tip 1"}
Care about your craft
:::

::: {.callout-tip icon="false" title="💡Tip 2"}
Think! About your work
:::

- The metaphor of the “broken window” is such a great example of how bad code can further lead to a bad project. “All the rest of the code is crap, I’ll just follow suit” 

- The example of how the firefighters went to put out a fire at a fancy house but place down a mat so they didn't ruin the carpet and how that equates to a project where the code is pristine you will take extra care not to mess it up. 

> Don't be afraid to make stone soup. Start with a POC that you can reasonably ask for then show people and let them marvel. Then say “of course… it would be better if we add..” 

> The early bird gets the worm but what happens to the early worm?

> Two or more things are orthogonal if changes in one do not affect any of the others

> Tracer code advantage: Developers build a structure to work in. The most daunting piece of paper is the one with nothing written on it. If you have worked out all the end-to-end interactions of your application and have embodied them in your code then your team won't need to pull as much out of thin air. 

> Think of prototyping as the reconnaissance and intelligence gathering that takes place before a single tracer is fired.

Come back to page 64-65 and do exercises 4-7
:::

> As a bonus at the end of this section we’ll reveal the single correct answer to give whenever anyone asks you for an estimate

- My guess is that it's “it depends”. (I was wrong it was "*I'll Get back to you.*")

> Each tool will have its own personality and quirks, and will need its own special handling. Each must be sharpened in a unique way, or held just so. Over time, each will wear according to use, until the grip looks like a mold of the woodworker's hands and the cutting surface aligns perfectly with the angle at which the tool is held. **At this point, the tools become conduits from the maker's brain to the finished product--they have become extensions of their hands.

> At some point you'll be surprised to discover your fingers moving ove the keyboard manipulating text without conscious thought. 

- I crave this feeling. I am not there yet but I have been working on my typing speed, vim and shortcuts in my editor. I have gone from 35wpm will proper typing form to 65wpm. I use a site called [typing.io](typing.io) to practice typing lines of code because programming usually involves characters that are not as common in normal typing like brackets, slashes etc. 

::: {.callout-tip icon="false" title="💡Tip 46"}
Don't Chain Method Calls
:::

- I am not sure how I feel about this tip. I am huge fan of chaining method calls and I often feel it reads better. Also I am pretty sure earlier in this book the author mentions how create the pipe system is in bash with all the different utilities you can use together. How is method chaining any different?

- The author does point this out in the next section **Chains and Pipelines** but it's still not clear to me how the author views these two as different things...

- One thing that I find interesting about **Reactive Programming, Streams and Events** is how it applies to so many different domains. The mindset of thinking about the world as a stream of events is a powerful one. The author even points out the influence this has had in web dev with frameworks like React. My background is in data and streaming platforms are commonly used in to handle real time data use cases. Usually they are paired with a stream processor that allows for real time transformations. Once you start to see it, it's hard to unsee the world this way. This is one strong belief I have about tech, the other is every software problem is a data problem. The author even makes a similar point 

    - > All programs transform data, converting an input into an output

::: {.callout-tip icon="false" title="💡Tip 49"}
Programming Is About Code, But Programs Are About Data
:::

- WOW, I love tip 49. I couldn't agree more.

> ***Concurrency*** is when the execution of two or more pieces of code act as if they run at the same time. ***Parallelism*** is when they *do* run at the same time.

> $O(1)$ Constant (access element in array, simple statements)
>
> $O(lg\ n)$ Logarithmic (binary search). The base of the logarithm doesn't matter, so this is 
>
> $O(n)$ Linear (sequential search)
>
> $O(n\ lg\ n)$ Worse than linear, but not much worse (Average runtime of quicksort, heapsort) 
>
> $O(n^2)$ Square law (selection and insertion sorts)
>
> $O(n^3)$ Cubic (multiplication of two $n*n$ matrices) 
> 
> $O(C^n)$ Exponential (traveling salesman problem. set partitioning)

> Think of code that needs refactoring as "a growth." Removing it requires invasive surgery. You can go in now, and take it out while it is still small. Or, you could wait while it grows and spreads--but removing it then will be both more expensive and more dangerous. Wait even longer, and you may lose the patient entirely.

::: {.callout-tip icon="false" title="💡Tip 61"}
Listen to Your Inner Lizard
:::

- The inner lizard is all about your *human instinct*, listen to them. When coding and you feel yourself struggling, take a step back and ask yourself why?

::: {.callout-tip icon="false" title="💡Tip 62"}
Don't Program by Coincidence
:::

- Program deliberately

> Some language communities prefer `camelCase`, with embedded capital letters, while others prefer `snake_case` with embedded underscores to separate words. The languages themselves will of course accept either, but that doesn't make it right. Honor the local culture.

- I love that last sentence *honor the local culture*. One of the many things I love about different programming languages is the culture around them is often unique. 

::: {.callout-tip icon="false" title="💡Tip 76"}
Programmers Help People Understand What They Want
:::

::: {.callout-tip icon="false" title="💡Tip 81"}
Don't Think Outside the Box--*Find* the Box
:::

- Understand the degrees of freedom and limitations of the problem before going to solve it. Be like Alexander the Great and chop the know to bits.

- Some of the most productive and impactful work I have done if my career has happened during pair and mob programming. I think it's a very underrated exercise.

::: {.callout-tip icon="false" title="💡Tip 85"}
Schedule It to Make It Happen
:::

> **Automation**: A great way to ensure both consistency and accuracy is to automate everything the team does. WHy struggle with code formatting standards when your editor or IDE can do it for you automatically? Why do manual testing when the continuous build can rust test automatically? Why deploy by hand when automation can do it the same every time, repeatably and reliably? 

- 🙌 Say it louder so the people in the back can here. AUTOMATE EVERYTHING. EVEN YOUR JOB AWAY.

- The *Pragmatic Start Kit* 
  - Version Control
  - Regression Testing
  - Full Automation

::: {.callout-tip icon="false" title="💡Tip 89"}
Use Version Control to Drive Builds, Tests, and Releases
:::

::: {.callout-tip icon="false" title="💡Tip 96"}
Delight Users, Don't Just Deliver Code
:::

::: {.callout-tip icon="false" title="💡Tip 100"}
It's Your Life.


Share it. Celebrate it. Build it.


AND HAVE FUN!

I admittedly didn't do the most important thing in this book and which was the exercises. I had a hard time putting the book down to take the time and do them. I want to come back and work through them.

# Review

I finished this book on 12/31/2023 and what a way to end the year. At the end of this book I was ready to run through a brick wall. There are very few books I have read in my life that have made me feel this way. I don't know how to put it into words but this book deeply resonated with me. I for one feel so grateful as someone who is so early into their programmer career to get to reap the knowledge of these authors who have distilled their wisdom, that they've gain over 45 years, down to under 300 pages. This book is a must read for any programmer or programming adjacent role. I am glad I got the hard copy of this book because I am going to keep it on my desk as a reminder who I strive to be, **A Pragmatic Programmer**.
