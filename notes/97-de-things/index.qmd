## Summary

**Rating**: ⭐⭐

Personally I wasn't the biggest fan of this format of short snippets from various data professionals. That's not to say I didn't learn anything, there were definitely some value tidbits in this book. Overall though I thought a lot of the material was repeated from various folks. I probably wont be recommending this book to anyone.
