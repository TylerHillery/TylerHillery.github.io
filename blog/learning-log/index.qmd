I have heard one of the biggest drops of cognitive ability happens after graduating college. It is crucial that if someone wants to continue to learn and improve their knowledge they need to set up deliberate time to learn even after schooling. A lot of people think that once schooling is over that the learning stops and the working starts. This could not be further from the truth. One of my favorite quotes about this is by Mark Twain 

> ***‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let schooling get in the way of your education‚Äù - Mark Twain***

I think so many of us, including me at one point, felt this way. That school was actually getting in the way my learning because of how structured it was. After schooling that structure is gone which can be daunting at first. It can be easy to get overwhelmed by the amount of resources that are available online. Don't overthink think this, just start! 

### **Make a public commitment to learn üì¢**
One way to stick to learning something is to announce it to the public. Being held accountable by others is a great way to stick your goals. This tactic is popular in challenges like [#100DaysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) where you suppose to code for 1 hour a day for 100 days and tweet about your progress. You are also suppose to commit your coding work to GitHub so you can see your activity on your GitHub's contribution graph [(Which is now available in 3D, VR and IRL ü§Ø)](https://skyline.github.com/TylerHillery). This was my main inspiration for creating the [Learning Log](https://share.streamlit.io/tylerhillery/learning-log/main).

### **Learning Log üìù**
The learning log is a python app that was developed using the open source library [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/). Streamlit makes it easy to turn python scripts into shareable web apps. The learning log helps keep track of your learning sessions. The heat map was designed very similarly to GitHub's contribution graph. I added some additional metrics like total time logged learning and learning day streak. Streamlit makes it easy to share this app to the public so others can see what you are learning about. I encourage you to fork my repo and start logging your learning!
